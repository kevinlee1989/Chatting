1. For using char** Design, the good thing is that it can simplified representation for display. This alternative design provides simplification of outputting the chat's data or rendering of it. Each chat data will store as complete char** data type including all ID, timestamp, user, message, reaction. So we don't have to combine or traverse to get all the data, we can just instantly output those data.
On the other hand, the bad thing is inefficiency of correction and using lots of memory spaces. As storing all the data into one sigle string, modifying any part of the chat would require parsing the whole string then modify it. Also, it increases memory usage because every small change might require to allocate new memory for the entire string. 

2. Since char** design, each chat will be stored as one formatted string. To implement the \edit function we should first parse the string then extract each data such as message or id. After I should make a correction of the message, I need to reconstruct a one formatted string which increases complexity of the code. When I keep doing this process in the future, it will also increase run time and make it efficient which also can lead to possibility of fragmentation.
