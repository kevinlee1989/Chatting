I used google sources and documentations to help me understanding of overall project of PA3.
I asked AI service about strncpy, how to set the time function, strstr, strtok to compile my code accurately.
I googled about the memory leak and the difference between the dynamic allocate and static allocate method.
I searched the google to get how to parse the string and how to extract after name= and after= so that I can get the value of the content.
